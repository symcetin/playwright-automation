Requirements:
- Use `import { test } from '@playwright/test';`
- Return only one code block containing the test function
- Leave the test title empty: `test('', async ({ page }) => { ... })`
- Do not include any code inside the async test body
- Do not add markdown, explanation, or any extra text outside the code snippet
